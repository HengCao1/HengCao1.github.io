# About Me

<img src="images/HengCao1MB.jpg" class="floatpic" width="448" height="448">

Here is **Heng Cao (操亨)**.

My research interests foucs on the reaction mechanism investigation of  **photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)** and **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR)** by advanced techniques like *in situ* XAFS and SFGS. Currently, I am working as an associate research fellow in the **National Synchrontron Radiation Lab** (NSRL) at University of Science and Technology of China, cooperate with [Prof. Jun Bao](http://team.ustc.edu.cn/Baogroup/zh_CN/).

## Research Interests

- CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction/CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation reaction mechanism investigation
- Synchrontron Radiation/Free Electron Laser based Charaterizations

My current research focuses on the **reaction mechanism investigation** of **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction** or **CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation** via advanced charaterizations, especially Synchrontron Radiation based (sXAS, XAFS, SRPES, DRIFTS, SVUV-PIMS) and Free Electron Laser based (SFG, nano-IR) techonologies. <br>
