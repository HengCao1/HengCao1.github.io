# About Me

<img src="images/HengCao.jpg" class="floatpic" width="330" height="480">

Here is **Heng Cao (操亨)**.

My research interests foucs on metal single-atom catalysis, and investigating their fundamental properties in **photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)** and **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction (CO2RR)**. Currently, I am working as a postdoctor in the **National Synchrontron Radiation Lab** (NSRL) at University of Science and Technology of China, cooperate with [Prof. Jun Bao](http://team.ustc.edu.cn/Baogroup/zh_CN/) and [Prof. Yang Pan](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/Pan_Yang).

## Research Interests

- Active sites modulation in metal single-atom catalysis
- CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation
- Synchrontron Radiation/Free Electron Laser based Charaterizations

My current research focuses on the **mechanism of how active sites work** in the reaction of **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction** or **CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation** via advanced charaterizations, especially Synchrontron Radiation based (sXAS, XAFS, SRPES, DRIFTS, SVUV-PIMS) and Free Electron Laser based (SFG, nano-IR) techonologies. <br>
