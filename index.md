## Research Interests

- Active sites modulation
- CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation
- Synchrontron Radiation based Charaterizations

My current research focuses on the **mechanism of how active sites work** in the reaction of **CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction** or **CH<sub>4</sub> photooxidation** via advanced charaterizations, especially Synchrontron Radiation based (XAS, SEPES, DRIFTS, SVUV-PIMS) and Free Electron Laser based (SFG, nano-IR) techonologies. <br>
